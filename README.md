# ADG_MovieVault

This is MovieVault, a web application that allows users to search for movies, view details, and watch trailers. Built using React, it fetches data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API to provide real-time movie information.

You can try it out here:

This has been built using React JS, Bootstrap HTML, and CSS.

Using 2 major folders for organization - Components and Pages, the code is very reusable and the styling in CSS is primarily spread over two files, App.css and List.css .

UI features such as hover animations, a visually appealing dark-styled theme and lazy loading have been added to improve user experience.
